<h1>About Me</h1>

I explore topics related to software development, covering different phases of a Software Developer's career journey, from Junior Developers to Principal Engineers and beyond. These topics hold significant importance for me, not only as a programmer but also in the context of technical interview preparation and personal growth as a software developer. I aim to share these insights through the lens of my own experiences.
